# Project's Progress 

_Project Overview_

This project aims to develop and optimize an AI model to automatically identify and extract key features from high-resolution drone orthophotos. The main features to be identified include building footprints, road networks, waterbodies, etc. The orthophotos used are part of the SVAMITVA Scheme, with labeled vector data provided for 10 villages.

_Project Implementation_

We identified the dataset containing raster data (orthophotos- in .ecw file format) and vector data (labeled data- in .gdb file format). Using QGIS software, we've loaded the dataset of Chattisgarh.

We converted all the vector layers to raster layers through rasterization process in QGIS software. These are few of the pictures of rasterized vector layers.
